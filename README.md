# Web Application Exercise

A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Product vision statement

Our app will aid in time management by providing a platform to organize and prioritize tasks, increasing productivity.

## User stories

1. As a user, I want to view all upcoming tasks and when they are due.
2. As a user, I want to be able to login and register to save the tasks that I have. 
3. As a user, I want to be able to add any tasks that come up during the day.
4. As a user, I want to be able to mark tasks as complete when I finish the tasks.
5. As a user, I want to be able to edit any tasks that I previously added if I need to make changes.
6. As a user, I want to search through the tasks that I have to find a specific task and either update its status, delete it, or check if it is in my task list.
7. As a user, I want to be able to delete any tasks that I am no longer in need of keeping track of. 
8. As a user, I want to be able to mark a task as completed with as little clicks as possible

## Steps necessary to run the software

1. Create and setup a python venv.
2. Install requirements from `requirements.txt`. For instance, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Create a .env file.
4. Populate the .env as specified in our mock `example.env`.
    - *note for graders: our .env is in our team channel on Discord*
5. use `flask run` to run the app

NOTE: *There is a user with 'test' username and 'test' password, which can be used for demoing. It's possible to also register a new account, using our register page.*
